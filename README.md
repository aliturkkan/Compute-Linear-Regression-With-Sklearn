# Compute-Linear-Regression-With-Sklearn

Data are collected via data set. Then, according to these values taken, the most optimal is drawn correctly using sklearn. If it is true that it is drawn, it provides a suggestion for the values that are to be estimated later. This method is called linear regression. If you want to change the dataset, you can create an appropriate set by examining the dataset saved on the system. The required dataset;

x0, y0
x1, y1
...
xn, yn

x = input values
y = output values
n = number of data
